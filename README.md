# drone_shows
This is the my final thesis about drone shows made in Untiy for Software Engineer.

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles known as drones. We can find them used for surveillance, rescue, transportation, military purposes, or entertainment. 
In this project, we will focus on the aspect related to entertainment.

To do this, we will simulate the behavior of a large group of drones to create various animations or shapes, both in motion and static, using the Unity 3D tool. 
To achieve this, we will need to code the behavior of the drones. This involves their movement, their ability to detect other drones and avoid collisions with them. 
Additionally, we will create animations in the air, manipulating the movement of the drones and the lights they incorporate to add more life and spectacularity to the animation. 
Furthermore, to make it more realistic, we will simulate the drones' batteries. 
Finally, a user interface will be incorporated to allow navigation between animations and to interact with them.
